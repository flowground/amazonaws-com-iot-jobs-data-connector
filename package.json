    "description": "AWS IoT Jobs is a service that allows you to define a set of jobs â€” remote\noperations that are sent to and executed on one or more devices connected to AWS\nIoT. For example, you can define a job that instructs a set of devices to\ndownload and install application or firmware updates, reboot, rotate\ncertificates, or perform remote troubleshooting operations.\n\n To create a job, you make a job document which is a description of the remote\noperations to be performed, and you specify a list of targets that should\nperform the operations. The targets can be individual things, thing groups or\nboth.\n\n AWS IoT Jobs sends a message to inform the targets that a job is available. The\ntarget starts the execution of the job by downloading the job document,\nperforming the operations it specifies, and reporting its progress to AWS IoT.\nThe Jobs service provides commands to track the progress of a job on a specific\ntarget and for all the targets of the job",
